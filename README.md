# nba-stats-visualizer
NBA stats visualizer is a web app based on React.js and Django framework and python and many other good things. Users would be able to ask a qualitative question on the player they are interested, and our backend will support that with a quantitative answer (and hopefully visualizations) based on real NBA data. Have fun with this small project!
